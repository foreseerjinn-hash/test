Welcome to my first website! I have been learning software development, with a focus on front-end, since June 2025, and building this site as a means to:
1. Test my skills and apply what I've learned
2. As the nascent stages of a much larger project
3. Fulfill my own creative expression - it's been a blast designing this!

After 6 revamps, I believe the site is close to being a finished product, however I am aware of the necessary changes and will make this my target over the next few weeks.

I will primarily be looking to correct the UX for the mobile design, having tested this myself I can see the UX I currently have is incompatible.
Additionally, the "personal" page is under development and so I have temporarily removed the functioning link for that page.

I primarily used Bootstrap and SCSS/SASS libraries for the UI/UX and overall design.
