      Narrative Design...
    </h4> 
<br>
    <p>
      ...is the art of creating narrative elements to support environs for larger projects, most often found in video games or TTRPGs. If you've ever played a game in The Elder Scrolls series, for example, you'll have seen the expanse first hand - in the many books you can read, the quests you can embark on, the flavourful dialogue and character drama and of course, the overarching story framing your journey through the many domains of Tamriel. 
<br>
<br> 
      Essentially, it involves creating everything from flavour text and storylines to character backgrounds and literary frameworks. Nowadays, this will usually be accomplished by a team of creatives, however, in its nascence (and sometimes, still to this day) this was undertaken by a talented, and very dedicated individual. It's the art of building your own little universe through words. 
<br>
<br>
      It began (arguably) in 1916 with J. R. R. Tolkien during the Battle of the Somme, who spent his time in the trenches inventing Quenya and Sindarin. This was later used as the fictional Elven languages in his canon, taking inspiration from Beowulf, the Mabinogoria and the Poetic Edda. Tolkien once said he wanted to "create a poetic legend (he) felt that England lacked", and in doing so he paved the way for subsequent greats such as Isaac Asimov, Gary Gigax, Ursula K. Le Guin, Terry Pratchett, George R. R. Martin, et al.
<br>
<br>  
      It's a craft I've been dabbling in for many years, and a formative concept that has shaped most of my life, and I will be compiling my collective work here. To start off I've added an example below from circa 2019-2020.

      Setting - Port town -
    </h4>
<br>
    <p>
      The first thing you notice is the sheer sensory onslaught of this town; smells of salt, sweat, liquor and fried foods, colours dreary and bright somehow simultaneously, with miscellaneous décor glistening in the high noon sun, the calling merchants, children screeching and the chatter of fishwives, drunkards and gamblers musing with the rise and fall of the surrounding surf, and a stifling, bristling humidity locked in stagnant breaths that clings to the skin and chokes out any essence of upstanding morality.
<br>
<br>
      But though the town’s atmosphere spoke of hard work and toil, there is none to be found. You move through the vibrant streets, littered with waste, empty bottles and the kind of colourful poverty you could only expect from a place built by pirates, sorry, ‘ethically flexible sea merchants’. Towering above are arching, narrow buildings of redbrick and timber, patched together with boats, buoys, masts, nets and brightly coloured chachkis; laundry lines and bunting hang overhead, threaded between windows and across the narrow cobbled streets winding off into the blackened heart of this dusk driven port. The boardwalk itself is crowded and alive, stalls and “budding entrepreneurs'' to either side, clamouring their wares in voices of those who never listen. Ships of all variants border the left hand side adding to the swathes of culture and commerce, and you struggle to dodge and weave between the unloading crews, day drunk delinquents and market goers. Kites and lanterns sway lazily overhead in a warm, salt smelling breeze, in tune to the sound of garbled chatter and windchimes you can’t see.
<br>
<br>
      You see a number of bars or taverns leaning out into the streets or tucked away down stairways a level beneath; boasting luminous, gaudily painted signs made out of anything the owners could find. The whole ambience was a sweet, tragic mixture of festivities and sadness; a dazzling, destitute wreckage of fool’s gold, false hope and dreams dashed on jagged, blackened rocks that line the seabed below.
<br>

      Fence
    </h4> 
      – 
    <p>
     <em>
       bright, conspicuous, toothpick, bald bad bitch.
     </em>
<br>
<br>
      You find her in the belly of a boarded off bar, drawing cards at a table of, well, to say misfits wouldn’t quite fit, because in a town of misfits are any of the misfits really ill fitting? The stench of cachaça and tobacco creates a sour air that tugs at you like secrets, desperate to escape, and a series of candles scattered about the room provides all the light you could hope to find here. The low glimmer allows you to just about see a group huddled around a table in the back end, snuggled up to the wall, almost cosy, the most grabbing of the cave dwellers here being a slight and hairless woman in a bold, red pantsuit, the sharp edges of her face catching the sickly glow of the flames, most pointedly the webbed, keloid scar splayed across the left side of her scalp, leading down to her brow. When you enter she gestures a palm up  to a set of empty chairs in front of a life-worn desk. “Just a minute, o fair patrons! Got a game to win.”  She turns her dark gaze over to you now with a grin, punctuated by a dangling toothpick that rests against a silver, canine tooth, before returning to the game. The next few minutes are tense, and deafeningly quiet, a composed silence broken only by the occasional grunt, sigh and the light flicker of cards against wood. “Better luck next time, boys!” She finally says rising from her seat and handing her winnings to a peculiar, put-together dwarf sporting a pinstripe suit, trimmed beard and set of pesnes. He quickly ambles through a backdoor with the sack of treasure before disappearing. Now situated behind her desk, resting her elbows at its surface and tenting her fingers, you notice that same dark gaze you glimpsed before has been resting pointedly upon yourselves, and as you turn back to her now holds your own. You feel the very kind of disturbed you’d expect when looking into eyes made for sinning. You can see the years have left its worn and weathered marks on her surface, a map of troubled waters, though you suspect it’s only somewhat telling of the depths that lie beneath. “Thank you for your patience,” she starts with surprising poise “What strange turn of satan brings folks such as yourself to my door?”

      Barkeep
    </h4>
      – 
    <p>
     <em>
      could rip yer head off, gentle giant, soft spoken, wise.
     </em>
<br>
<br>
     You round the corner to hear the telltale heave-ho of a party-pooper being cast out onto the street by the heavy toss of the barkeep/proprietor for the Hermit’s Lamp, a spacious and impressive tavern at the heart of the boardwalk and, most often, action. Standing in the doorway of this establishment is what can only be described as a veritable behemoth of a man, giving a swift kick with his heavy, leather boots to the trash that he just took out. “You can come back when you’ve learned to keep yer hands to yerself.” He states matter-of-factly before spitting at the curbside next to the drunkard, “eyy, what dyou expect! What’s wrong with a guy knockin back the tinnies aft’r a ‘ard day! Where’s the sin in that?!” “I’m not gonna stand here an’ argue with you, mate. You know what’s up. Hands. To. Yourself.” and with that he returns to his post, but not before moving over to a beautiful, young woman sitting at the edge of a platform in the far corner of the room; you can’t hear what he’s saying but you see him rest a hand on her shoulder and crouch down beside her, before moving back behind the bar after a weak smile and a wave of her hand. “Just, let me know, okay?” This is the tail-end you catch as you enter the room to see him now busying himself behind the counter.
