      Narrative Design...
    </h4> 
<br>
    <p>
      ...is the art of creating narrative elements to support environs for larger projects, most often found in video games or TTRPGs. If you've ever played a game in The Elder Scrolls series, for example, you'll have seen the expanse first hand - in the many books you can read, the quests you can embark on, the flavourful dialogue and character drama and of course, the overarching story framing your journey through the many domains of Tamriel. 
<br>
<br> 
      Essentially, it involves creating everything from flavour text and storylines to character backgrounds and literary frameworks. Nowadays, this will usually be accomplished by a team of creatives, however, in its nascence (and sometimes, still to this day) this was undertaken by a talented, and very dedicated individual. It's the art of building your own little universe through words. 
<br>
<br>
      It began (arguably) in 1916 with J. R. R. Tolkien during the Battle of the Somme, who spent his time in the trenches inventing Quenya and Sindarin. This was later used as the fictional Elven languages in his canon, taking inspiration from Beowulf, the Mabinogoria and the Poetic Edda. Tolkien once said he wanted to "create a poetic legend (he) felt that England lacked", and in doing so he paved the way for subsequent greats such as Isaac Asimov, Gary Gigax, Ursula K. Le Guin, Terry Pratchett, George R. R. Martin, et al.
<br>
<br>  
      It's a craft I've been dabbling in for many years, and a formative concept that has shaped most of my life, and I will be compiling my collective work here.
